# Day 04 #100DaysUItoFrontend - Smoothie Store Homepage

This project is the coded version of my Day 03 design â€” a smoothie store homepage focused on freshness, simplicity, and visual appeal. The goal was to translate the static design into a responsive, functional web page using clean HTML and CSS.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

HTML5 â€“ for semantic and accessible structure
CSS3 â€“ for layout, styling, and responsiveness
Google Fonts â€“ for modern, clean typography
Grid â€“ for organized and adaptable layouts

ðŸ’¡ What I Worked On

Building a structured layout from the Figma design
Styling consistent color schemes and typography

ðŸš§ Challenges Faced

The biggest challenge was aligning and scaling images so they matched the visual proportions of the design without losing quality. It required experimenting with different sizing methods (object-fit, aspect ratios, and container adjustments) to get the right balance.

ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

Add smooth animations and hover effects
Enhance interactivity for better user experience

Optimize for faster loading
